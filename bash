STD

 

&> This is STDERR and STDOUT

1> STDIN

2> STDOUT

&>  is 2>&1

 

 

Whenever you execute a program, the operating system always opens three files, standard input, standard output, and standard error as we know whenever a file is opened

 

So 2>&1 simply says redirect standard error to standard output.

& means whatever follows is a file descriptor, not a filename.

$ ls -l file_doesnot_exists > /dev/null
ls: cannot access file_doesnot_exists: No such file or directory

Despite I'm redirecting output to /dev/null, it is printed in the terminal. It is because we are not redirecting error output to /dev/null, so in order to redirect error output as well, it is required to add 2>&1:

$ ls -l file_doesnot_exists > /dev/null 2>&1
