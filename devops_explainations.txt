ci
pushing the code (commit) and checking it
cd
deployment the code on a mock server=ready for the deployment

repository is where all the information like code/documantion and more

maven is a project management and also automatio n tool
maven is a build / project management tool

artifact=project

interview:
use the word repositoary, svm

Usually, the build process would also include code analysis, unit testing, archiving etc. All these can be achieved by integrating Jenkins with the corresponding tools (like we did for the SCM and the build tool).


delivery - deploy on tested server
deploy -deploy on real production
pipeline - every section of the pipeline has jobs to do some processing/action

differnce between jenkins to maven:Essentially difference is that Maven is build tool while Jenkins of Hudson is a Continues Integration tool.

validate
compile
test
package

if i do package then automatically it will do all the phases before that, and if one of them fails
then it wont continue to package




can i build several jobs at the same time?
whats the deal of the goals
whats the differnce between jenknis buikd to maven's?



A compiler takes the Java code that you write and turns that code into something that can run on your computer


**/*.war   = any war file which is archived in the package job


build=compile,code review,unit testing,integration test,package(WAR,JAR,etc.)

continous delivery- jenkins will take the package file (war or jar, or etc) that in the CI was created and deploy it on the test server, I am not sure but i think that package file is called artifact
