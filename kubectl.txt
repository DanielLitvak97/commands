deployment upgrades /rollback the pods images by creating new replicasets. and also deploy pods.
you can create pods from RS but you cant upgrade and roll back



first label is JUST to identify the deployment, e.g:
kubectl get deployment -l app=nginx

second label is of the RS, you tell the RS which labels of PODS to look at, also SERVICE checkes those labels.

third label is to identify the pods for the RS and if there is no RS then for the SERVICE.
