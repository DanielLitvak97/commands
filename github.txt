git remote add origin https://github.com/DanielLitvak97/commands.git
git push -u origin master
git pull origin master  - make sure you PULL when your head in git is in master
git clone https://github
git push origin master
git push origin NEW - by doing this you create a new branch in github
git rm NAME - delete a file

git pull = git fetch + git merge
git pull - even if there is a conflict it will still do the merge
git fetch - is safe, so even if there is a conflict you can still fix it
git merge origin/master

so when fetching:
git fetch
in git status you will see maybe a conflict, then you you edit it and do "git add ." and then merge and hten maybe git push
